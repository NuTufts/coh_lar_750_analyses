# Archive of Ben Harris' Reco programs

Ben wrote the following programs to reconstruct the vertex using a dual-band prototype geometry for COH-LAR-750.

These are saved here for archival purposes. No attempt to ensure the programs in this folder can build.

The programs depend on ROOT and also the class definitions from COHERENT's cenns10geant4 repository, branch `tmw_json_sd_config`.
